# Ruby !!!
## Ruby on Rails is built with Ruby
## high level language
# Interpreted
# object oriented programming
# we use the programming language to do some operation and functions

# datatypes
Hello World - called string
123, 7777 , 9 - integer
1.4,6.8,9.10,5.69 -float numbers 
True and false = boolean
true is 1 in binary 
false is 0 in binary 
array[] it is collection of data type, it can be uniq or anything .... index or position of array start with 0
hash {} it is key, value.- {name : "chaitee" , empid : 9, role :"educator"} easy to search by value or by key , uniq data type. 
symbol - :supplies;

## mathoperators : +,-,*,1,%,**
##irb it is interactive ruby (built in gem) 
## variables : 
- a = 5 # we are assigning 5 to a

puts in new line and print in same line.
! mark change the original in programming language we call it mutates.(capitalize !)/ modifies the original string.

downcase /upcase is a method which only go with strings.
"hello"*5 = "hellohellohellohellohello" 
"hello" + " world" = "helloworld"
5.to_s + "hello" = "5hello"

when we want to see the born year , the formula is  yearborn =[ current year - age ]
whatever we want to print that time just put the particular things in #{name of things}
conversion " .t_i "
# sleep (2) its just pause for 2
# lucid.app/lucidchart.
# in ruby gets.chomp is give the white element input area .


# in ruby language we have two type of operators , 1. logical operators [&& , || , exor] , relational operators [ >,<,>=,<=.,!=]

AND LOGIC ALWAYS USE WHEN BOTH ARE TRUE / BOTH ARE FALSE ,  
F && T [[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] FALSE , 
F && F [[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] FALSE , 
T && F[[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] FALSE ,
T && T [[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] TRUE,


OR || LOGIC ALWAYS USE WHEN ANY  TRUE /   FALSE ,
T || T [[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] TRUE,
F || F [[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] FALSE,***
F || T [[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] TRUE,
T || F [[THE AND LOGIC OUTPUT IS]] TRUE,

elsif is the second if condition.

# make sure give a space in between the bright and ? this is the method of ternary operator.

single line comment is #
multiline comment is =begin , =end

when is also a if conditions , as a multiple. 

in ruby if we check the range we write like 18...45

# for while loop the loop gets executed
# has long a the condition is true. as below.

# iteration 1 ======  a = 0 ; 0 < 10 print 0 ,a = 1
# iteration 2===== a = 1 : 1<10 print 1 , a = 2
# iteration 3===== a = 2 : 2<10 print 2, a = 3
# iteration 4===== a = 3 : 3<10 print 3 , a = 4
# iteration 5===== a = 4 : 4<10 print 4 , a = 5
# iteration 6===== a = 5 : 5<10 print 5 , a = 6
# iteration 7===== a = 6 : 6<10 print 6 , a = 7
# iteration 8===== a = 7 : 7<10 print 7 , a = 8
# iteration 9===== a = 8 : 8<10 print 8, a = 9
# iteration 10===== a = 9: 9<10 print 9 , a =10

while jar_empty
cups_added = cups_added + 1
puts "added #{cups_added} cups of water" # empty jar joto bar jol add hobe upto 12 ba full jar porjonto print hobe.
if cups_added >= jar_size # jodi cjol bhorte bhorte 12 ba tar theke besi hoye tokhon stop hoye jabe .
jar_empty = false
end
end 
# duto end holo ekta while jonyo opor ta if jonyo
puts "the jar is full"


#Hash {brownie : 4 , coffee:5 , toast:6}
#Hash {"brownie" => 4 , "coffee"=>5 ,"toast" =>6}
# both writing style are right
pipe operator is |key , value.| , pine operator is called place holder
# menu.each {|key , value| puts "#{key} price is #{value}"}|
# menu is variable here 

# numbers = [1,3,5,7] , creat  array as numbers 
n write because array has been delclared as a number its a place holder |n|
# numbers.each{|n| puts n} , 

instead of n can write any element like m , monkey , lemon , jira , egg etc.

when we write element ointo the hash then we have key and value, but when we make array that time we do not have key or value separately, its a single element.



# numbers = [11,22,35,65]

# index /position of 0 = 11 , 1 = 22, 3= 35 , 4= 65

# how to print each element of the index of array. we will apply the ech loop 

# number.each_with_index{|n ,  index|,puts "we have #{n} at index #{index}"} # string interpolation

# method definition to execute certain instruction in javascript its call functions

def tieshoeslace
puts "wear shoes"
puts" cross the lace"
puts "tie a knot"
puts "you are good to go"
end
# for a method to be executed it has to be invoked/called
# now we are invoked method.
tieshoeslace
a method can not run / print automatically we need to do invoked.

# map methods 
# $ sign in front of variable that makes global variable.
