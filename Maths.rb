# an object-orianted programming language
#No"primitives"
#Most everything is an object in ruby.
# all are object in ruby , x is a variable and 1 is a object and the return value is object
#variable scope indicators : global($variable) , class(@@variable),instance(@variable) , local( variable) , Block(variable)
# first ruby object is a integers
# Numbers /numeric = 1 is integers ,2 is  floating-point num bers ('floats;") 
#maths operations : (+0 , (-), (*),(/) , ( ** it is power). standard math rules : PEMDAS
# PEMDAS =is a simple equations.
# MATHS ASSIGNAMENT OPERATORS= X=4 , X+= 2 , X-=3, X *=2, X /=5 , (SAME AS : X = X+2//X-3//X*2//X/5)
#when we write 1234.class automatically it will show in ruby that is integer means object.
#next is use for behaviour
#abs method for absolute value.
# floats = 12.34 , 13.0.class =FLOAT ,13.class =INTEGER ,<<<<<FLOAT AND INTEGER BOTH ARE DIFFERENCE>>>>>
#numbers methods are abs , round , floor , ceil.
#sequence of character is string .
#strings:escaping.[ "Let's escape!"  'Let's escape!']
#\t = tab
#all hash key should be unique value means not same , all must be different from the others. array is order collection , hash is a unorder collections.
#we can not edit the symbols
#key is always a symboltes
# inclusive ranges , exclusive ranges
#NIL IS AN OBJECT
